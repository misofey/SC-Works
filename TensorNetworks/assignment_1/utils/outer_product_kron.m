function outer = outer_product_kron(varargin)
    % OUTER_PRODUCT_KRON takes a list of variable number of vectors varargin as input and
    % computes the outer product between them using the kron function which
    % is builtin in MATLAB.
    % INPUT list of variable number of vectors varargin.
    % OUTPUT outer product tensor.
